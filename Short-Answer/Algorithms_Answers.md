#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) I'm going to go with O(n**2) on this one, but to be honest, this bit of psudocode is blowing my mind. I also kind of feel like it's O(n), though, because there's only one loop, so can we put that as my back-up answer, please? :)


b) See, now this one looks like O(n) to me, too, which is making me rething all of my other answers. It does have two loops in it, but one's a while loop. 


c) This example is O(n) because the output increases as 'n' increases. 

## Exercise II

I know we're not supposed to get distracted by the questions, but WHAT KIND OF EGGS ARE THESE.
