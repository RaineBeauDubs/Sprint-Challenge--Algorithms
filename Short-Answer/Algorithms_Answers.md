#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) I'm going to go with O(n**3) on this one now.


b) See, now this one looks like O(n) to me, too, which is making me rethink all of my other answers. It does have two loops in it, but one's a while loop. 


c) This example is O(n) because the output increases as 'n' increases. This one actually is O(n)

## Exercise II

I know we're not supposed to get distracted by the questions, but WHAT KIND OF EGGS ARE THESE.

This may also be getting distracted by the question, but wouldn't the easiest thing with eggs to be to start from the bottom of the building? To be fair, the number of floors in this building doesn't seem to be definied, so I wouldn't be able to start at a midpoint. 

So would that be O(n), then? Or do I just have a problem thinking everything is O(n)? 

Oops, I guess the building is defined by n-number of floors. In that case, it's definitely O(n), because the number of floors you have to check is directly linked to the number of floors there are (I still think you should start at the bottom, though).
